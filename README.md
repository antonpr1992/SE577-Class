My name is Anton Prokopenko, and this is my first artifact as part of SE 577 (Software Architecture) class at Drexel University. I am taking this class as part of the M.S. in Software Engineering curriculum, which is the degree that I am pursuing. My prior coursework includes the post-bachelor Computer Science gateway sequence (CS501 throuh CS504), Software Design (SE575), and Software Reliability and Testing (SE576). In those courses, I had an opportunity to learn object-oriented programming fundamentals, design patterns, and unit testing. In this SE577 course, I am looking forward to learning modern software architectures to be able to create applications consisting of multiple modules and deploy and run them.
